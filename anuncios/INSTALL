Note from the creator:

Thanks for downloading the phProfession source. I hope you enjoy using the script as much
as I have enjoyed creating it. Feel free to modify and enhance the code as much as you'd like.
Drop me a note if you've done any cool things with the script, and I'll be sure to put
a sign of recognition on phprofession.sourceforge.net.

	Thanks!
